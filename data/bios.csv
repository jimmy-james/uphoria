Outside of hometown Chicago, they may be best known for high profile and excellent remixes of Daft Punk, Neon Indian, Black Moth Super Rainbow and DFA 1979. Back home they are justly celebrated for legendary performances such as their set at Wicker Park Fest that turned the entire neighborhood into a vast and energized dance floor, forcing even the palest and most resolutely hard-to-impress hipsters to call up their inner dance monsters. Live performances combine loops, samples and Mickey Kellerman's keyboards with Darren Heitz's drums plus Felix Moreno's Larry Graham-style bass slapping to create an enormously powerful groove. Their light show is as good as their music, and their set have been known to inspire dance frenzies.",http://www.futurerock.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/FR_press_photo_2010.jpg

With a focus on layers and melody, bassist Elliott Vaughn provides a steady backdrop groove to compliment the axe wizardry of Brandon Maynard. With both members adding in carefully crafted beats and samples, the sound is met in a musical utopia by the explosive percussion of drummer Seth Fankhauser.With two studio albums now under their belt and a third in the works, the band has arrived at their most mature and polished sound to date. Their latest live release, Live From Earth 2010 compilation, features new and unreleased material including very special guest performances from Mike Rempel (Lotus) and Dominic Lalli (Big Gigantic), along with remastered versions of fan favorites & a free download of the track High Hopes.

Outlet,http://www.outletmusic.net/,https://www.facebook.com/whatisyouroutlet,https://soundcloud.com/outlet,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71VQ4v824qI,"Jonathan Belfontaine, otherwise known as Outlet, was destined to make music from the very beginning. At the young age of 13, Jon was given a guitar by a neighbor. Soon afterward, he stumbled upon a broken amp, took it apart and put it back together into working condition, his drive for music was strong enough for him to learn amp repair before learning an A cord. How Jon learned guitar and music in general began with the records of his parents, tapes and the radio these were Jon's main teachers, he trained himself to pick out notes, and play along with any song. Over the years, he's really had fun with this idea of learning any song first pass as he calls it he is often found playing along to different radio stations and sitting in with various bands when ever they let him jam with them. Jon has been a member of many different rock bands, most notably the group Hate Radio, Something and Mantra but his musical interest never stopped at just the guitar, always picking up a bass or a set of drumsticks. He's been known to show up at blues Jams and leave his guitar in the car walking in with drum sticks and rock the kit for a few. While being influenced in different genres of rock, he also became deeply integrated into the electronic scene. The idea of blending so many of his favorite musical styles and the limitless ideas that can come from a pair of headphones and a synthesizer was all it took to spark his interest in EDM. Summer of 1997 he bought his first 16 track sequencer and was learning the ropes, experimenting with making music from scratch that was all his own, with psychedelic melodies and hypnotic tones, empowered with heavy bass lines. If you look for it you'll find some of these early Outlet sessions online. After a brief hiatus starting in 2007, his burning passion was reignited when he and his soul mate Elisabeth Marcoux went to 2008's Rothbury Music Festival in Michigan. Hearing the mind blowing artists perform with such love and high energy, and being immersed in the unified and uplifted crowd, sparked Jon's need to make music again. The discovery of Ableton Live, allowed him to explode into creativity again, being a ten year veteran to digital computer software such as Cubase and Cakewalk, Ableton's cutting edgeness really allowed Jon to dive right into it this time integrating the sounds of hip hop, soul, funk and trance. He has now been producing a dance oriented, groove inspired, glitchy style of music that is energetic, passionate and fun. Of course, infusing his positive vibrations healing frequencies and inspiring light, baked into every morsel of each tantalizing song. The concoction of organic sounds whipped and blended with original bass lines and drum patterns, along with his ability to manipulate the texture and flavor of each synthesized note will leave the listener delighted in savoring every delicious layer baked into every song!",https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/405154_10150689258835768_460915961_n.jpg
Laser Sex,,https://www.facebook.com/LaserSex,https://soundcloud.com/lasersex,http://lasersex.bandcamp.com/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE21hRBO7c0,"Hailing from Scranton, PA, this hyper-dynamic musical duo combines an endless stream of musical genres to create a fresh take on electronic dance music. The keystone to their colorful art is their versatility, as both creators Mike Nasser and Jeff Felkowski emerge from very different musical backgrounds. This difference in influence comes together seamlessly in their composition to create an ever evolving sound that is unique unto them. Nasser, playing the bass, guitar, keys, and samples, provides a strong foundation in funk music. This element is the most common denominator among their repertoire. Felkowski, also playing guitar, keys, and samples, provides an incomparable feel to the composition that helps Laser Sex achieve their innovative sound. On stage every instrument gets routed into their main computer where Nasser and Felkowski can take live samples of themselves and each other. The use of live sampling creates an almost orchestral feel to their performance. At times it will sound like there are six or more people performing rather than two. The use of live sampling in tandem with the use of samples from other artists leaves the audience unable to predict the direction of each performance. Ultimately, audiences will come to expect the unexpected when seeing Laser Sex perform live. Laser Sex entertainment is unprecedented and full of groundbreaking, superb musicianship. They are progressively uniting electronic music with fundamental genres while incorporating imaginative character.

Gorilla Finger Dub Band,,https://www.facebook.com/Gorillafingerdubband,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_SEx40pyKs,"Gorilla finger, is a reggae band like no other, performing a improvised style they refer to as soul-rock-reggae. The sound is reminiscent of Bob Marley Peter Tosh Sublime and presented in a fashion similar to jam bands or world dance acts.The band was formed in the spring of 2011 during a series jam sessions and open MIC performances headed By front man Chris B and bassist Eric D. The band immediately picked up a strong local following and a alternating cast of musicians. The first gorilla finger dub band show was in Brooks Maine at the way life should be festival. Soon after the band took a more solid state of being after Sammy B took over the drum kit with Nathan Tarbox on hand drums. They picked up an uncountable amount of festivals, bars, music venues, house parties, and even a NYE show to close out 2011.In the winter of 2012 the band held a Wednesday night residency at flask lounge in Portland Maine, where they held held an open air audition for Keyboardist Robbie Cooper. The same open air spirit was held a few weeks earlier when Guitarist Steven Martin passed the test, performing a Bob Marley tribute show at Port city music hall unrehearsed. During the winter months the band played a series of shows at The Widow Maker and the Rack at Sugarloaf eventually leading to their Performances at Sugarloaf reggae weekend. Soon after the band opened for J-boog and booked into many Festivals around New England. Including Uphoria in New York, Ziontific in Vermont, Harry Browns Farm in Maine, Maine vocals, and Heads in Harmony and Jahloving in Mass. The band released it first album cool it down in the fall and picked a show at the state theater opening for Badfish; a sublime tribute.

After a few years of experimenting and fine-tuning, Friendship and Stoo now create a show that is one of the most dynamic spectacles ever produced by two people.

Durians,http://www.duriansmusic.com/,https://www.facebook.com/DuriansMusic,https://soundcloud.com/duriansmusic,http://durians.bandcamp.com/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC-_sazP95Y,"The Durian, the spiny, stinky fruit, is both famous and infamous in its native home of South-East Asia. Eliciting emotions that range from respect to disgust to adoration, the fruit has earned the nickname, King of Fruits, and has been banned in many hotels and public areas due to its smell. No doubt this brash fruit is an appropriate namesake for the Brooklyn live Electronic/IDM/Dubstep band, Durians. The trio's powerful presence and sound are as impressive and unique as the fruit's funky odor.Although the group uses recognizable elements from the newest DJ-dominated Electronic Dance Musicgenres, Durians never sticks to formulas. Wobbly bass lines are played from Nick Kirshnit's hybrid MIDI/Electric bass, which come out aggressive, dirty and compelling. Drum n' bass and jazz-infused dubstep beats are played by drummer Ryan Ramirez, which further provides the crucial live element to their music. Melodies and sounds from Eli Chalmer are provided not just by synths and sounds produced by laptop, but by live trombone, keyboards, and unique original instruments such as MIDI-Theremin.The idea began with longtime musical cohorts Kirshnit and Chalmsky in Burlington, VT. Having played in dirty jazz-funk bands together for a long time, the two were eager to indulge in electronic experimentation. The success of the project eventually compelled them to move to New York City, where they met drummer Ryan Ramirez, a recent transplant from North Carolina. Ramirez, an already accomplished session drummer with Soul/Funk ensembles, had been inspired by Electronica drummers such as Adam Deitch, Jo-Jo Mayer and KJ Sawka. He, Kirshnit and Chalmsky clicked and immediately began work on releasing their music.After releasing two EPs, and a few singles, Durians have been growing in notoriety in the North-East. They find themselves at home in a variety of scenes, from EDM, to IDM, to Jamtronica, even picking up fans of jazz and heavy metal.",https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-55FgNLwzcxc/TUt2zdpQp1I/AAAAAAAAACE/OHzIM7w5rQg/w1347-h898-no/IMG_5738.JPG
