Marco Benevento,"Brooklyn, NY",http://marcobenevento.com,https://www.facebook.com/marco.benevento,,,,"For more than a decade pianist/sound-sculptor/songwriter Marco Benevento has been amassing an extensive resume of composition and collaboration. His studio albums have set forth a vision for music that connects the dots between Explosions In The Sky and Tortoise on one side, Brian Eno and Brad Mehldau on the other, while in the live setting his performances reverberate with pulsating dance rock energy. The 34-year old artist takes the next step forward in this evolution with his latest album, TigerFace, on which he paints his songs in a myriad of sonic colors, shimmering with acoustic piano, synths and analog keyboards. The tunes themselves seemingly conceptualized from every wisp of melody, hook and cadence that's ever tickled his ear.Recorded and mixed by Tom Biller (Silversun Pickups, Fiona Apple) and Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Akron/Family), TigerFace features a stellar cast of musicians recruited to help capture his ideas, including drummers Matt Chamberlain (Bill Frisell, Pearl Jam), John McEntire (Tortoise, The Sea & The Cake) and Andrew Barr (The Barr Brothers), bassists Dave Dreiwitz (Ween), Reed Mathis (Tea Leaf Green) and Mike Gordon (Phish), violinist Ali Helnwein (Traction Avenue Chamber Orchestra) and saxophonist Stuart Bogie (Antibalas, Superhuman Happiness). For the first time, Benevento presents vocals, inviting Kalmia Traver (Rubblebucket) to sing on the infectious dance rock rave-up Limbs Of A Pine and the pastoral psych rock meditation This Is How It Goes. Other standouts include the angelic Arcade Fire meets The Flaming Lips anthem ""Eagle Rock,"" the soaring garage psychedelia of Going West, the piano riff rock jaunt Escape Horse, and the happily lilting Fireworks.As anybody who's seen Benevento perform live can attest, the pianist is a satellite to the muse with eyes closed, smile wide across his face and fingers free-flowing across the keys. Indeed, TigerFace, is the commitment to this pursuit; a record that rides the yes wave and in the process becomes a soundtrack for fellow travelers with their eyes set on the horizon.",http://marcobenevento.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/120605_benvento_179-Edit.jpg

Live performances combine loops, samples and Mickey Kellerman's keyboards with Darren Heitz's drums plus Felix Moreno's Larry Graham-style bass slapping to create an enormously powerful groove.

At the young age of 13, Jon was given a guitar by a neighbor. Soon afterward, he stumbled upon a broken amp, took it apart and put it back together into working condition, his drive for music was strong enough for him to learn amp repair before learning an A cord. How Jon learned guitar and music in general began with the records of his parents, tapes and the radio these were Jon's main teachers, he trained himself to pick out notes, and play along with any song. Over the years, he's really had fun with this idea of learning any song first pass as he calls it he is often found playing along to different radio stations and sitting in with various bands when ever they let him jam with them. Jon has been a member of many different rock bands, most notably the group Hate Radio, Something and Mantra but his musical interest never stopped at just the guitar, always picking up a bass or a set of drumsticks. He's been known to show up at blues Jams and leave his guitar in the car walking in with drum sticks and rock the kit for a few. While being influenced in different genres of rock, he also became deeply integrated into the electronic scene. The idea of blending so many of his favorite musical styles and the limitless ideas that can come from a pair of headphones and a synthesizer was all it took to spark his interest in EDM. Summer of 1997 he bought his first 16 track sequencer and was learning the ropes, experimenting with making music from scratch that was all his own, with psychedelic melodies and hypnotic tones, empowered with heavy bass lines. If you look for it you'll find some of these early Outlet sessions online. After a brief hiatus starting in 2007, his burning passion was reignited when he and his soul mate Elisabeth Marcoux went to 2008's Rothbury Music Festival in Michigan. Hearing the mind blowing artists perform with such love and high energy, and being immersed in the unified and uplifted crowd, sparked Jon's need to make music again. The discovery of Ableton Live, allowed him to explode into creativity again, being a ten year veteran to digital computer software such as Cubase and Cakewalk, Ableton's cutting edgeness really allowed Jon to dive right into it this time integrating the sounds of hip hop, soul, funk and trance. He has now been producing a dance oriented, groove inspired, glitchy style of music that is energetic, passionate and fun. Of course, infusing his positive vibrations healing frequencies and inspiring light, baked into every morsel of each tantalizing song. The concoction of organic sounds whipped and blended with original bass lines and drum patterns, along with his ability to manipulate the texture and flavor of each synthesized note will leave the listener delighted in savoring every delicious layer baked into every song!",https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/405154_10150689258835768_460915961_n.jpg

The keystone to their colorful art is their versatility, as both creators Mike Nasser and Jeff Felkowski emerge from very different musical backgrounds. This difference in influence comes together seamlessly in their composition to create an ever evolving sound that is unique unto them. Nasser, playing the bass, guitar, keys, and samples, provides a strong foundation in funk music. This element is the most common denominator among their repertoire. Felkowski, also playing guitar, keys, and samples, provides an incomparable feel to the composition that helps Laser Sex achieve their innovative sound. On stage every instrument gets routed into their main computer where Nasser and Felkowski can take live samples of themselves and each other. The use of live sampling creates an almost orchestral feel to their performance. At times it will sound like there are six or more people performing rather than two. The use of live sampling in tandem with the use of samples from other artists leaves the audience unable to predict the direction of each performance. Ultimately, audiences will come to expect the unexpected when seeing Laser Sex perform live. Laser Sex entertainment is unprecedented and full of groundbreaking, superb musicianship.

Eliciting emotions that range from respect to disgust to adoration, the fruit has earned the nickname, King of Fruits, and has been banned in many hotels and public areas due to its smell. No doubt this brash fruit is an appropriate namesake for the Brooklyn live Electronic/IDM/Dubstep band, Durians. The trio's powerful presence and sound are as impressive and unique as the fruit's funky odor.Although the group uses recognizable elements from the newest DJ-dominated Electronic Dance Musicgenres, Durians never sticks to formulas. Wobbly bass lines are played from Nick Kirshnit's hybrid MIDI/Electric bass, which come out aggressive, dirty and compelling. Drum n' bass and jazz-infused dubstep beats are played by drummer Ryan Ramirez, which further provides the crucial live element to their music. Melodies and sounds from Eli Chalmer are provided not just by synths and sounds produced by laptop, but by live trombone, keyboards, and unique original instruments such as MIDI-Theremin.The idea began with longtime musical cohorts Kirshnit and Chalmsky in Burlington, VT. Having played in dirty jazz-funk bands together for a long time, the two were eager to indulge in electronic experimentation. The success of the project eventually compelled them to move to New York City, where they met drummer Ryan Ramirez, a recent transplant from North Carolina. Ramirez, an already accomplished session drummer with Soul/Funk ensembles, had been inspired by Electronica drummers such as Adam Deitch, Jo-Jo Mayer and KJ Sawka. He, Kirshnit and Chalmsky clicked and immediately began work on releasing their music.After releasing two EPs, and a few singles, Durians have been growing in notoriety in the North-East.

The band has taken their improvisational nature of old and paired it with a little more structure to bring about what they have today. Ready to play any show and willing to play almost anywhere, STC loves the opportunity to play the music they love in front of people and to feel the true energy that is present between the audience and the band during their shows. In the process of finishing up their first EP, Stop Tito Collective is looking for 2013 to hold new experiences, more shows, and more music.",https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/580053_10151584053942193_432845975_n.jpg
